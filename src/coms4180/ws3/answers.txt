question 1:
a.  all the rules use pattern matching to detect known attacks.
b.  this basic approach could suffer two problems:
      1. attackers could try to avoid all of the known patterns.
      2. attackers could swamp snort with a lot of attacks of known patterns as noise and then hide the true intrusions among the noise


question 2:
a.
iptables -A INPUT -m iprange --src-range 200.168.20.10-200.168.20-40 -j DROP

b.
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -A INPUT -s 128.124.0.0 -j ACCEPT

c.
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp –-dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp –-dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

d.
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -d $SERVERBOB/22 -j ACCEPT

question 3:

3 nodes are the minimum number of nodes to create an anonymous path so that the first node knows who is sending traffic and where the traffic is going, the second node knows nothing and the third node knows where the traffic is going to.

but if there are only two people using the network, there's no anonymity left as to who the other party is for any two way traffic.

question 5:
Star topology is easiest to disable when the central C&C is detected and blocked because it has a single point of failure.

question 6:

a. "GM Bot" is a mobile banking trojan that is capable of harvesting
usernames and passwords using slick keystroke-capturing website overlays and stealing two factor authentication including SMS and even redirecting
phone calls.

b. Diffie-Hellman cryptographic algorithm was used in Angler Exploit kit to make it harder for the firewall to detect the exploit and for analysts to get the exploit code.

question 7:
a. browsers is the most common. Java saw a decrease.

b. number of ransomware attacks increased by more than 100%.

c. Adobe Flash had the most zero-day exploits. Due to code quality and complexity of Flash, McAfee believed in the continuation of vulnerability in Flash.
